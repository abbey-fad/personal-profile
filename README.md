# Abiodun Fadipe

Hello, GitHub! 👋

I'm **Abiodun Fadipe**, a Front-End Developer and aspiring full-stack developer. I am passionate about creating clean, accessible, and functional websites that enhance user experience. My background in teaching has strengthened my communication, problem-solving, and collaboration skills, which I bring into every project.  

Currently, I am pursuing a **Certificate in Web and Computer Programming** at Brigham Young University–Idaho (BYU–Pathway Worldwide), where I’ve gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive design, and version control using Git.
